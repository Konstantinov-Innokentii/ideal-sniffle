## Out gitflow
We have two main branches - **master** and **develop**. Straight push to them is **not** allowed.
To create your own branch you need to checkout it from **develop**.
When you finish you work on it make sure latest develop merged into and then create MR.
(If you have problems with resolving merge conflicts contact head-dev. Do not push your merge commit in this case)

##Our ticketflow

We use github for issue tracking.
On project tab you can see our board.
When you take an issue please move it to the 'doing' column and add 'doing' label. When task is finished and mr is created,
change **doing** label to **ready for review**.
For estimates calculation we use **Everhour** (Currently works in Chrome only)
https://app.everhour.com/
Afer installing browser extenstion you will see time and progress fields in the issue.
